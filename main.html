	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. 
    An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient since it performs faster for larger inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total memory used by an algorithm, including input and auxiliary space. 
    The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), 
    which helps evaluate how memory usage grows with input size.
